PROFILE

C++ and Python developer with a BSc in Civil Aviation Management and a strong focus on AI architectures, algorithmic trading systems, complex systems simulation and signal processing.

Since 2019 I have been designing and implementing the CODE-21 / GODBRAIN ecosystem: a multi-agent, doctrine-driven architecture that combines evolutionary computation, behaviour-aware trading engines, parameterised universe simulations and frequency-based communication experiments.

I am now looking to formalise this work within the MSc Data Science and Computational Intelligence at Coventry University, and to develop it into rigorous, publishable research.

PROFESSIONAL & PROJECT EXPERIENCE

Founder & Lead Developer – GODBRAIN / CODE-21
Istanbul, Türkiye – 2024–Present

Independent technology venture registered in Türkiye, focused on AI architectures, algorithmic trading research, simulation and signal-processing experiments.
•	Designed the GODBRAIN (CODE-21) meta-architecture: a multi-agent, doctrine-driven system with:
o	SERAPH orchestration and governance layer
o	COUNCIL ensemble decision engine
o	BUGKEEPER self-healing and rollback agent
o	DNA Registry for evolving strategy and policy genomes
•	Implemented services in Python, C++ and Node.js, with PostgreSQL-style relational storage and structured logging for replay and analysis.
•	Developed formal doctrine documents (risk limits, behavioural constraints, shutdown rules) and translated them into machine-enforced configurations.

Architect & Developer – GODMONEY Tetra Core Engine
2025–Present

Research platform for algorithmic trading in crypto derivatives, built on top of GODBRAIN.
•	Implemented a Tetra Core architecture:
o	NEXUS (orchestrator), CORTEX (strategy logic),
o	VANGUARD (execution & exchange APIs),
o	SENTINEL (real-time risk monitor),
o	supervised by APEX controller.
•	Built multi-process Python services to achieve true parallelism and strict separation between decision, execution and risk layers.
•	Integrated exchange APIs in demo/sandbox environments with controlled risk exposure; implemented persistent logging of all states, decisions and trades.
•	Connected the engine to the DNA Registry, allowing strategy genomes to be backtested, scored and promoted/retired under doctrine constraints.

Designer – Human-Mind Atlas (Behavioural Trading Dataset)
2022–Present
•	Collected and anonymised historical trading data from hundreds of real accounts (e.g. BTCUSD derivatives).
•	Engineered features capturing:
o	entry/exit behaviour, leverage, drawdowns and recoveries,
o	behavioural motifs such as “holding through large losses” and over-leveraging.
•	Used this dataset as a behavioural baseline for AI strategies: genomes are evaluated not only for performance but also for similarity to or divergence from known human failure modes.

Designer & Developer – GODCOSMIC_CORE (C++ Universe Simulation – in development)
2023–Present
•	Designed a C++ simulation engine where each Φ-Genome defines a parameterised “universe” (dimensions, entropy rules, determinism, interaction complexity).
•	Specified UniverseMetrics to quantify structural complexity, stability, emergence of self-replication patterns and agent-like behaviours.
•	Planned an evolutionary loop to search over Φ-Genomes, favouring universes that support complex, long-lived structures; intended as a research sandbox for complex systems and artificial life, and as a generator of synthetic environments for testing AI strategies.

Lead Researcher – FREQUENCY_LAB (Signal & Frequency Experiments)
2023–Present
•	Converted a professional audio studio into a signal-processing lab for frequency-based communication experiments.
•	Generated and recorded controlled audio patterns (tones, sweeps, modulated signals, structured noise) under varying acoustic conditions.
•	Analysed recordings as numerical data, measuring spectral content, SNR, dynamic range and interference.
•	Defined Ψ-Genomes encoding candidate frequency protocols (channel parameters, modulation schemes, symbol mappings, semantics).
•	Developed fitness functions combining information capacity, robustness, energy efficiency and symbol separation, with the goal of evolving a robust frequency “language”.

Designer – GODLANG & LOGOS_CORE (DSLs and Thought-Graph)
2024–Present
•	Designed LOGOS_CORE, a persistent “thought graph” that stores ideas and hypotheses as structured nodes and clusters.
•	Began developing GODLANG, a family of domain-specific languages:
o	GODLANG.COSMIC for universe definitions and experiments,
o	GODLANG.FREQ for frequency protocols,
o	GODLANG.FIN for financial regimes and risk doctrines.
•	Built a pipeline from idea → GODLANG specification → experiment (GODMONEY / GODCOSMIC_CORE / FREQUENCY_LAB) → data → updated doctrines, creating a closed loop suitable for academic research in knowledge representation and program synthesis.
 
OTHER EXPERIENCE (BRIEF)

Music Producer & Sound Engineer – Freelance
Istanbul, Türkiye – 2014–Present (part-time alongside technical work)
•	Produced, wrote and arranged songs for several well-known Turkish recording artists, achieving 100M+ cumulative streams on digital platforms.
•	Managed full audio production chain: recording, editing, mixing, mastering and delivery to labels.
•	This experience now serves as a practical foundation for my work in signal processing, psychoacoustics and frequency-based communication in the FREQUENCY_LAB project.
